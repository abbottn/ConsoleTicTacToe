# ConsoleTicTacToe
Practice what you've learned in this course by creating a console app Tic Tac Toe game.  To make it interesting,
let the user choose how many players and how many columns and rows to place in the game grid.

Ask each person their name when starting a game, and tell each person by name when it is their turn to make a move.

Use classes to define data structures to hold the game grid.  You will need arrays of cells since each user can
define how many rows and columns there are.

There's no need to try and build an artificial intelligence (AI) to play against you.  All players can be people
using the same console window.
